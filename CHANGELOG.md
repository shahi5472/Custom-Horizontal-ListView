## 1.0.0

* As a Flutter Developer, one common issue we encounter is related to horizontal lists. Sometimes,
  it becomes challenging to maintain dynamic item heights within such lists. However,
  I have a solution that I'd like to share. By using this code, the horizontal
  list should now have dynamically sized items, making it more flexible to accommodate various
  content heights.
